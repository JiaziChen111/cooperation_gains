Hi Luca,

please find attached the full IMF review model files for a simple instrument rule, 
the ramsey policy and the nash policy both with complete and incomplete markets.

The file call_nonlinearnopot contains the information for the .mod files. 
The folder contains the steady state files as well. In detail:

nonlinearnopot - instrument rule, incomplete markets
nonlinearnopotcomp - instrument rule, complete markets
nonlinearnopot_ramsey  - ramsey, incomplete markets
nonlinearnopot_nash - nash, incomplete markets
nonlinearnopotcomp_ramsey - ramsey, complete markets
nonlinearnopotcomp_nash - nash, complete markets

The layout of the parameter files is as in the IMF review project. 
Key for now is link the programs to the welfare programs to compute consumption compensations. 
I can the play with the parameterisation, although for now I intend to 
stick with the one we have with the exception of consumption habits 
which need to be sufficiently low for all models to solve.
